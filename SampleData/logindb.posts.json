  "description": "For my first 3 terms in dlsu, i already cried 3x. And I don‚Äôt easily cry. The first one was when I was overwhelmed by final reqs at final exams a week before the finals during the first term. The second time was during midterms last term. I just had my 3rd cry today, one freaking month after the term started. I haven‚Äôt taken any long exams for this term yet, but I am already tired and feeling anxious. If I can‚Äôt handle 21 units (this term), how am I going to survive next term (w/ 24 units)? I know college is hard, but I want to know how do u manage to not get burnt out or take care of your mental health while maintaining ur academic life :(",

  "description": "Once or twice per term I like to randomly dress as a banana and walk around campus.</br></br> But now I think id like to level up my game and introduce a second banana. Kaya im finding someone na malakas ang trip or into cosplaying to dress up as a banana with me and hold hands to stroll around campus. </br></br> Prefferably a girl sna, pra it looks funny and cute, no romantic intended, palakasan lang ng trip wahahaha (pero oks rin if your a guy :>) </br></br> We are going to act like a normal couple and pretend as if we are not dressed up as a banana then well just stroll around the campus </br></br> We‚Äôll also eat bananas while wearing our costumes and just chill </br></br> This will be a three day event (Tues,Thurs,Fri) pra all colleges can experience the banana. Im planning to execute this plan after independent learning week pra more free time </br></br> PM if interested :)) </br></br> Were also wearing sunglasses btw pra coolüòº </br></br> (I cant provide the costumes na im out na hahahahaha)",
